## 4. Key Insights

- **Weekly Sales Over Time**  
  From February to November, weekly sales typically range between 40M and 50M.  
  There are noticeable small peaks around the 1st to 10th of each month, and dips around the 20th to 31st.  
  A medium-sized peak occurs in late November (around 60M–70M), and a significant spike appears between December 20–26, reaching 70M–80M.  
  These patterns indicate strong seasonality and consumer behavior cycles tied to monthly and holiday events.

- **Holiday Impact on Sales**  
  This box plot compares weekly sales distributions between holiday and non-holiday periods.  
  Median sales are visibly higher during holidays, showing that holidays generally drive stronger performance.  
  However, non-holiday periods display more high-value outliers, indicating occasional weeks with exceptional sales even outside official holiday seasons.  
  This suggests that while holidays are key drivers of revenue, targeted strategies during non-holiday weeks could also yield significant gains.

- **Prophet Forecast with Confidence Intervals**  
  This forecast visualizes weekly sales projections for the next 12 weeks using Facebook Prophet.  
  The blue line represents predicted sales, while the shaded area shows the confidence interval (e.g., 90%) reflecting uncertainty around the forecast.  
  The model captures seasonality and growth patterns based on historical trends.  
  A notable surge is expected around December 21, 2012 — aligning with past holiday peaks.

- **Anomaly Detection in Weekly Sales**  
  This chart identifies abnormal spikes in weekly sales using a 4-week rolling average and standard deviation.  
  Most anomalies appear from late November to late December, linked to Black Friday and Christmas demand surges.  
  This emphasizes the need for proactive resource planning during the holiday season.

- **Monthly Sales Heatmap per Store**  
  This heatmap highlights month-by-store sales variations.  
  Certain stores exhibit exceptionally high sales during specific months, likely due to regional factors or local events.  
  This suggests potential for deeper geographic or market-specific analysis.

- **Store Clustering (Unsupervised Learning)**  
  Stores were grouped based on total sales, average weekly sales, and holiday sales impact.  
  The results reveal clear segments of store behavior and performance.  
  Such clustering enables more tailored strategies per segment.

- **Feature Correlation Heatmap**  
  Positive correlation between `Rolling_Mean` and `Weekly_Sales` suggests recent performance predicts current sales well.  
  Fuel price shows moderate correlation with year, consistent with long-term trends.  
  Negative correlation between `CPI` and `Weekly_Sales` implies inflation might suppress sales to some extent.

- **Price Sensitivity Analysis (Regression)**  
  Linear regression assessed the impact of CPI and fuel price on weekly sales.  
  The R² score was very low (~0.005), meaning these variables explain little sales variance.  
  Suggests price alone is not a strong driver — other operational or behavioral factors may be more important.

## 5. Business Recommendations

- **Prioritize holiday readiness**  
  Allocate more inventory, workforce, and logistics during high-sales periods, especially from late November to December.

- **Leverage store segmentation**  
  Customize promotions and operations per store cluster for better ROI and efficiency.

- **Track economic indicators cautiously**  
  While macroeconomic variables are informative, they are weak predictors of short-term sales. Use them in context.

- **Use forecast tools operationally**  
  Implement Prophet-based forecasts in planning inventory, staffing, and promotions 2–3 months ahead.

- **Investigate regional trends**  
  Deep dive into standout store-month combinations to uncover local advantages or missed opportunities.

## 6. Limitations

- **No regional granularity**  
  No geographic data is provided, so regional trends and differences are not directly analyzable.

- **Lacks product/category breakdown**  
  The dataset only includes aggregate store-level sales — product-level insights are unavailable.

- **Weak economic predictors**  
  The low R² score indicates CPI and fuel price are not sufficient to model weekly sales trends.

- **Historical scope is limited**  
  Data ends in 2012, which may affect model generalizability to current market behavior.

- **Customer behavior not included**  
  No demographic, loyalty, or behavioral data is available, which limits targeting and personalization insights.
